# Cool Things

I've started keeping a list of things I think are cool, worth the time to check out, accompanied by some brief gloss on each. Cool things that are widely known are intentionally omitted since there's not much point giving them ink here. Some of the things here may not actually be _good_, but for one reason or another they seemed to rise above.

## [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/)

I chanced on this blog several years ago via a link aggregator and after years of mulling over what I read there entirely too much, I'm still not entirely sure if the guy is serious or if it's a joke. I'm pretty sure it's serious, but every now and then doubt creeps in. Rao's prose is quirky and grandiose, often convoluted (intentionally... I think), but under all that there are interesting ideas. Or at least sufficiently weird idea-collages wherein trying to comprehend them produces an interesting subjective experience. Some good starting points would be [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) and [The Boydian Dialectic](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/06/18/the-boydian-dialectic/). Roa offers [his own suggested starting points](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/for-new-readers/) as well.

## [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)

Ostensibly a hacker news clone, lobsters was spawned (as many HN clone are) in response to a perceived drop in quality and a distaste for the Silicon Valley politics. One the latter point I could take it or leave it, lobsters ended up with moderate left leaning politics which is probably better than the HN vibe, but not by a lot. The quality situation is, I think, objectively better than HN is today. There's still plenty of flavor-of-the-month going on, but the focus does manage to remain technical and more niche topics have room to breathe (ex: there seems to be a comparatively thriving formal methods sub-community going on). Generally anything that shows up on HN that you'd actually want to read turns up on lobsters, and some cool stuff you wouldn't see there doesn't get buried, so for my two cents it's a drop in replacement.

## [JSPaint](https://jspaint.app/)

A loving recreation of Windows 95 mspaint. I have a little code in this project, and I use it to do ho-dunk diagrams now and then. Even if you're not looking for something heavy and full-featured, I'm sure there are better raster graphics editors in the world, so maybe it's just nostalgia. But I love to crack it open and just doodle, and if you spent hours in classic mspaint like and enjoy the very raw method of creating images this way you'd probably be into it too. One particularly impressive aspect is the addition of features like transparency in a way that really honors the UX of classic mspaint.

# Groundnut Stew
An African inspired stew made with peanuts. Excellent served over rice with a quarter lime's worth of juice squeezed over the top. You can add chicken for extra protein. Jalapeno works as a substitute for serrano although it does change the flavor somewhat. Add more cayenne or chili pepper to bring up the spice level.

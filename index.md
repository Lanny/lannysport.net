# Lannysport

I'm Lanny, I make some things. My largest project in recent years has been [ISS](#ISS). In the course of that project I started [Houston](#Houston), which is a Django app aimed at providing site usage analytics, sorta like Google Analytics but without all the privacy invasion and likely selling off of data. Lately I've been working on a project aimed at delivering synchronized video playback in modern browsers over networks with non-negligible latency, [CGRO](#CGRO). I don't name all my projects after space stuff, I swear. I also make little games sometimes, most notably web based implementations of [Onitama](#onitama) and [YINSH](#YINSH).

## ISS<a name="ISS"></a>
ISS (short for "International Space Station", although no one calls it that) is a piece of BBS style forum software.

## CGRO<a name="CGRO"></a>
CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) aims to deliver synchronized video playback between a small number of peers.

## Onitama<a name="onitama"></a>
Onitama is a bit like chess, I guess.

## YINSH<a name="YINSH"></a>
YINSH is weird, but I like it.
